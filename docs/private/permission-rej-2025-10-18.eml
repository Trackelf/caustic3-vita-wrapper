Hi Silvan, you have my permission to ship the .so, including an unlocker
app equivalent for use in your port project:

=E2=80=9CI permit a non-commercial community distribution of a PS Vita port=
 of
Caustic 3 and bundling of libcaustic.so and the unlock package inside the
VPK. No support from me

Good luck,
Rej

I know what you mean but I don&#39;t see any problems in this case because=
=C2=A0 it is a port and not a official release. You can have a look on the =
<a href=3D"https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_=
blank">https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it</a> database which lists all of our=
 ports right now. For example: If someone want to get GTA San Andreas worki=
ng on the Vita he has to buy the android version and copy paste the data fi=
les from the apk to the vita. Don&#39;t ask me why but I think there will b=
e no body to get a ps vita port support from rockstargames... if you know w=
hat I mean. Officialy there is no one who complaines about problems with ho=
mebrews because it is just a option to get android apps running on other de=
vices which are known for that they coulnd&#39;t run android games. I canno=
t guaranteed you that there will be no &quot;mental easy person&quot; which=
 will use your support email adress for complaining about the app port but =
the amount of people will be very very low.=C2=A0 On the other hand your Ca=
ustic3.apk is based on android 2.2.0 and I wouldn&#39;t see any problems to=
 get this think working perfectly except the points I have listed in the pr=
evious mail. <br></div><div><br></div><div>We have to know what the key.apk=
 does with the main files of caustic. I&#39;m affraid to see that your caus=
tic 3 key is based on the android phone hash which downloads it from playst=
ore, so the key.apk would generate a unique key for the main app which chec=
ks the phone IMEI or hashrate of something to get sure that the key is righ=
t. Otherwise we have to write another apk loader for the key to simulate th=
e phone IMEI on the ps vita to make caustic3 activation work correct.<br></=
div><div>In the key.apk there is a libcaustickey.so file and I think it wil=
l be installed in a path of android which I don&#39;t know jet. There is no=
 .so file in Caustic3 folder so we have to know how to deal with the libcau=
stickey.so and then the activation process will be fine I think.</div><div>=
<br></div><div>Anyways... I appreciate your statement and I will thank you =
for your openness. I will tell my people about our writing and we will see =

exact file structure of caustic3 to make the exporting and saving process p=
ossible. This is nessesary for the whole port of caustic3.</span></div><div=

nting piracy is a very big point. First of all we could port the free x86 v=

=3D"auto">We want the user to buy caustic 3 key. They have to download and =
install both : the key and the main application. Then they has to run a app=
2apk extractor to get both .apk files on internal phone storage. After that=
 they have to copy both of the apks to the Vita, install both of them and o=
